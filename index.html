<p>Well, where to start? Firstly lets look at some of the news of the past week.</p>
<p>Joachim Parbo's CX1</p>

Former Danish Cyclo-cross champion Joachim Parbo revels in cold, wet and muddy conditions: he finds that the worse the weather, the better for him. He’s been tuning his poor weather set-up for a while, but his recent switch to Leopard Cycles' new carbon CX1 has provided him with a super stable and lightweight platform to launch into the mud with gusto. 

When BikeRadar caught up with him in Colorado, we asked him why he favours the dire elements so much. 

“The others break mentally,” he said. “It demands different power output in certain sections and I have that. Maybe I’m not so good with speedy, criterium-like courses, but when it gets more technical I’m usually doing better.”

We also discovered that Parbo has just exchanged his trusty ProTek Cycles aluminum frame for Leopard Cycles’ new carbon CX1. The CX1 may be Leopard’s first attempt at the genre, but Parbo says his initial impressions have been good.

“This is my first carbon bike, so I was surprised that it was stiff, very light and very responsive. The ride is a little softer than an aluminium bike, which is fine for ‘cross,” he said.
